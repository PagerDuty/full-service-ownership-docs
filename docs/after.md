### Support and Handing off On-Call
Practicing proper support for the team will make the full-service ownership experience better. Along with showing empathy for teammates, communicating to the next on-call any issues that have not yet been resolved or any other experiences that happened during your rotation will alleviate unnecessary headaches. This should happen during the regularly scheduled on-call handoff.  During the on-call handoff review the metrics to foster a culture of observability; this will give the team a true picture of both the infrastructural health and human health. You can do this through:

*   Team disruption statistics
*   Chat history
*   Custom reporting

Look for ways to improve, are there areas of concern that are uncovered during the on-call rotation that need more follow-up?  Are there noisy alerts that need to be cut down to reduce alert fatigue? Is there a service that is constantly alerting that needs analysis of contributing factors?

### Etiquette
As on-call etiquette will make the on-call experience better for everyone involved. Panic helps no one, reduces productivity, and causes anxiety during an already stressful situation. A few on-call etiquette tips are:

*   If the current on-call comes into the office at 12pm looking tired, it's not because they're lazy. They probably got paged in the night. Cut them some slack and be nice.
*   Don't acknowledge an incident out from under someone else. If you didn't get paged for the incident, then you shouldn't be acknowledging it. Add a comment with your notes instead.
*   If you are testing something, or performing an action that you know will cause a page, it's customary to "take the pager" for the time during which you will be testing. Notify the person on-call that you are taking the pager for the next hour while you test.
*   "Never hesitate to escalate" - Never feel ashamed to rope in someone else if you're not sure how to resolve an issue. Likewise, never look down on someone else if they ask you for help. Ensure your management supports this policy.
*   Always consider covering an hour or so of someone else's on-call time if they request it and you are able. We all have lives which might get in the way of on-call time, and one day it might be you who needs to swap their on-call time in order to have a night out with your friend from out of town.
*   If an issue comes up during your on-call shift for which you got paged, you are responsible for resolving it. Even if it takes 3 hours and there's only 1 hour left of your shift. You can hand over to the next on-call if they agree, but you should never assume that's possible.
