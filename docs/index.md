As the complexity of environments continues to increase, bringing accountability directly into the hands of the engineers for the code and services they create becomes a competitive advantage.

Enabling individuals and teams to own their code allows organizations to function on the edge of the customer experience, reduce the impact of disruptions, and focus on innovation.

The full-service ownership methodology brings agile and devops best practices to engineers providing them the ability to ensure the reliability of their systems and services through a deeper understanding of how their code functions in production.
