## Full-Service Ownership
Full-service ownership is the model in which engineers are empowered to own their code, services, and systems at every stage by using the "code it, test it, ship it, own it" process. The full-service ownership model provides the framework for traditionally structured development teams to innovate faster and run more reliable systems. This process leads to multiple benefits for the individual, team, and organization through:

- Empowering engineers to own the systems they create, leading to higher quality and more resilient systems.
- Increasing collaboration and breaking down silos.
- Putting the focus on real time operations.
- Reducing the business risk of incidents through consistent and repeatable methodologies.

## On-Call
Being on-call means that you may be contacted, at any time, as a subject matter expert responsible for the proper operations of systems that you own. On-call shifts are shared within a team through an on-call rotation schedule. When the need for your participation to resolve an issue is necessary, you are notified via defined channels (e.g., chat, SMS, call, email, app, etc.). You are expected to acknowledge the notification, triage, resolve, or escalate the issue as needed.

## MTTA & MTTR
Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) is used to measure the average time between when an incident is triggered, and a user acknowledges it (reassign, resolve, and escalation does not imply acknowledgment).

Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) measures the average time between when the incident is triggered, and when it is resolved (acknowledge, reassign, and escalation does not imply resolution).
