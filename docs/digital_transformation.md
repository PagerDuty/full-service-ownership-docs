Systems will inevitably fail and, when they do, the time it takes you to recover is the difference between competitive advantage and market failure. To survive in the digital world, you must ensure the lowest possible time to restoring services by empowering your engineers to own their services and systems in production.

Digital transformation is now top of mind for CEOs and is imperative for organizations to remain relevant.

[The PagerDuty State of Digital Operations 2017 UK report showed](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/reports/digital-operations-uk/):

> "When a digital app or service is unresponsive or slow, 86.6 percent of consumers said they are likely to temporarily switch to an alternative mobile app or website to complete their task. 66.8 percent of respondents said they were likely to never use the app or website again.‚Äù

Even if customers don't completely abandon a company, the financial and reputational cost of unavailable services can be crippling. A two-hour system outage at a major retailer was recently forecast to have cost the company 50 million dollars.

Systems will go down; it's a fact of operating. However, companies can significantly mitigate business risk by reducing the time to restoration by ensuring that engineers are empowered and able to own their services and systems. Full-service ownership reduces resolution time by bringing the subject matter expert in as the first responder while at the same time decreasing chaos and panic, through the adoption of on-call.

On-call is the best way to ensure reliability and availability of systems and services. on-call allows for accountability to outcomes that matter. Engineers are most successful when they are empowered and accountable for these outcomes. With advances in tooling, cloud computing, and numerous platforms that make all of this possible, engineers are naturally getting closer and closer to the end-user and customer experience. You can even say that engineers are the true owners of the end experience and are in the best position to affect change.

Full-service ownership leverages the empowerment of on-call to benefit both the business and the individual engineer. With the shift to the cloud, the role of engineers has drastically changed over the last few years to spend less time on infrastructure needs and spend more time on the customer experience. This is an exciting time to iterate, improve, and ultimately to take ownership over the code that is written. Ownership, responsibility, and accountability all ensure engineers are doing high-value work; as engineers now have a direct line of sight into how their product(s)/service(s) are performing and impacting the customers' day-to-day. Additionally, this new responsibility of ownership provides feedback directly into the hands of the developer.
